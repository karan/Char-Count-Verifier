Char-Count-Verifier
===================

My first GUI program in Java using Swing.
This simple program prompts you for a name of a 
file that must exist in the same location as the
program and them shows the lines which are over 
MAX_LINE_LENGTH.

I created this program before I started using Eclipse
so I could check my classes for crazy long lines, and
stop losing points on my homework assignments.
